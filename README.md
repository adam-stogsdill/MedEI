# MedEI
MedEI - Medical Electronic Intelligence ( A compilation of tools and AI techniques to create a hub of Medical AI work )

#### What this project will be?
I want this project to be primarily a place where I can place my own projcts in AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) pretaining to the Medical domain specifically. I also do want to compile some techniques in gene analysis that I learned from my earlier projects but using more state-of-the-art ( SOTA ) algorithms to perform that. Finally, I do want to mention that I want this code-base to be as professional as possible so a lot of documentation will be attached to everything. 

#### Tools and Languages ( Will be updated as this project continues )
Currently, I will most likely be using Python as the primary coding language.

#### About Me!
As of May 26, 2020, I am an undergraduate student at Colorado School of Mines majoring in Computer Science with a focus in Robotics and Machine Learning. I've been programming in Java for most of my life at this point, but only recently did I discover AI and ML ( Machine Learning ) and have fell in love with it so much.
